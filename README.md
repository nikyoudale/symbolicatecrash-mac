Ever run into problems symbolicating a crash report for your Mac or iOS app? Simba is here to help!

You will need the crash report (.crash), the original binary executable file, and a .dSYM file of symbols. 

This app symbolicates the crash report for you, using Atos.

More details on this approach to manual symbolication can be found [here](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/troubleshooting/advanced-symbolication/).
